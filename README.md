## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven, a 3rd year Computer Science major and aspiring full stack developer at the University of Georgia!

I love to work with VSCode, personal projects and Emacs. I enjoy working with [Java](https://www.java.com),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org).

Currently interested in learning Spring, Node, and PostgreSQL!
